[OSCMessages_0_4 Comprehensive List of OSC Messages (0.4 branch)]

[OSCMessages Comprehensive List of OSC Messages (trunk)]

The following documentation refers to the current release of SAM and the SAM client library (version 0.4).

== Developing Clients ==

== Developing Renderers ==

== Developing User Interfaces ==
SAM UIs communicate with SAM using Open Sound Control (OSC) messages.  OSC messages can be sent to SAM over UDP or over TCP using SLIP encoding.  Currently, all OSC messages sent from SAM to a UI use UDP.

=== Registering a UI with SAM ===
A UI must register with SAM in order to receive notifications of clients being added or removed as well as global parameter updates (volume changed etc.).  The format of the OSC messages for registering and unregistering a UI can be found [OSCMessages_0_4#SAM/UI_Messages here].

=== Subscribing to Parameter Changes ===
When a client is added, SAM notifies all registered UIs and provides a unique ID for the client.  If a UI wishes to receive notifications when that client's parameters change, the UI must subscribe to the parameters of interest using the OSC messages listed [OSCMessages_0_4#Subscribing_to_Changes here].  All subscription messages require the unique ID for the client to which the UI wishes to subscribe.  

Subscribers are notified when a parameter has changed using `/sam/val` messages described [OSCMessages_0_4#Getting_Parameters here].  To request the current value of a parameter at other times, the `/sam/get` messages listed [OSCMessages_0_4#Getting_Parameters here] can also be used.  Metering updates are broadcast once per second.  UIs can unsubscribe from parameter notifications using the messages [OSCMessages_0_4#Unsubscribing_from_Changes here].

=== Setting Parameter Values ===
The `/sam/set` messages listed [OSCMessages_0_4#Setting_Parameters here] can be used to set the value of a parameter.  Global parameters are set by using an id of -1, while client parameters are set using the unique client ID provided to the UI when the client was added.
